<h2>My Role</h2>
My role within the GDW group is a developer. <br>
I expect to contribute in making the main gameplay features for the game. For our current game 'The Outreach' this would include things such as the inventory system, portals, destructible meshes, minecart system, and much more. 

<h2>Weekly Updates</h2>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
During this week I worked on the input system, animations and a basic test area. The input system allows the player to control the game using both a keyboard and a gamepad. The added animations includes idle and walk.

<h3>Week 2</h3>
During week 2 I worked on adding a score manager, a health system, and pickups. The score manager will add score whenever the player picks up a coin. The health system will give any object health, they can take damage and heal. The pickups include things such as a heart to heal the player and a coin to add score. There is also a crab which when touched will deal damage.
